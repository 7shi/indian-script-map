# Indian Script Learning Tool

Interactive educational tool for understanding the genealogy and relationships between Indian writing systems through visual tree diagrams.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. Educational - Clear, structured learning progression that builds understanding systematically
2. Intuitive - Visual relationships that make complex script genealogy immediately understandable  
3. Engaging - Interactive exploration that encourages discovery and deeper investigation

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Multiple script families to explore with interactive tree navigation and detailed script information panels

## Essential Features

**Script Family Tree Display**
- Functionality: Interactive tree diagram showing hierarchical relationships between Indian scripts
- Purpose: Visualize how scripts evolved from common ancestors (Brahmi, etc.)
- Trigger: Page load displays main tree, clicking nodes reveals sub-families
- Progression: Load main tree → Click script family → Expand to show derived scripts → Click individual script → Show details panel
- Success criteria: Users can trace any script back to its historical origins

**Script Detail Panel**
- Functionality: Information panel showing script characteristics, time period, regions, examples
- Purpose: Provide educational context for each script in the family tree
- Trigger: Clicking on any script node in the tree
- Progression: Click script → Panel slides in → Display script info, sample characters, historical context
- Success criteria: Comprehensive information helps users understand script features and usage

**Interactive Navigation**
- Functionality: Pan, zoom, collapse/expand tree branches
- Purpose: Handle large family trees while maintaining readability
- Trigger: Mouse/touch interactions on tree canvas
- Progression: Zoom to overview → Navigate to area of interest → Expand specific branches → Focus on details
- Success criteria: Smooth navigation without losing context or orientation

## Edge Case Handling
- **Empty/Loading States**: Show skeleton tree structure while data loads
- **Mobile Layout**: Responsive tree that works on small screens with touch navigation
- **Deep Nesting**: Collapsible branches prevent overwhelming visual complexity
- **Missing Data**: Graceful handling when script information is incomplete

## Design Direction
The design should feel scholarly yet approachable - like exploring an interactive academic diagram that makes complex linguistic relationships visually clear and engaging to discover.

## Color Selection
Analogous color scheme using warm earth tones that evoke ancient manuscripts and traditional learning.

- **Primary Color**: Deep indigo (#2E1065) - represents knowledge and scholarly tradition
- **Secondary Colors**: Warm amber and terracotta tones for different script families
- **Accent Color**: Bright saffron (#F59E0B) for highlighting active/selected elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Warm cream #FEF7ED): Dark indigo text (#2E1065) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Cards (Pure white #FFFFFF): Dark indigo text (#2E1065) - Ratio 9.1:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep indigo #2E1065): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 9.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Saffron #F59E0B): Dark indigo text (#2E1065) - Ratio 4.7:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey scholarly authority while remaining highly readable for complex script names and technical information.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Script Names): Inter Semibold/20px/normal spacing  
  - Body (Descriptions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Labels (Tree nodes): Inter Medium/14px/tight spacing

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that guide attention and reinforce the tree structure relationships without distracting from educational content.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Tree branch expansions and node highlighting communicate hierarchical relationships
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Node selection gets primary animation focus, with secondary movement for tree navigation

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Dialog for script details, Card for information panels, Button for tree controls, ScrollArea for content overflow
- **Customizations**: Custom tree visualization component using SVG with D3.js for interactive diagrams
- **States**: Tree nodes have hover, selected, and expanded states with color and size changes
- **Icon Selection**: ChevronRight/ChevronDown for expansion, Info for details, ZoomIn/ZoomOut for navigation
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px base unit for tree node spacing, 24px for panel margins
- **Mobile**: Tree becomes vertically scrollable list view on mobile, with tap interactions for expansion
